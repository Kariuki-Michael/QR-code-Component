Proceeded on to the CSS to add the colors and making the projects more lively and well organized.

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

-In this project, I was able to learn how to center an element both vertically and horizontally using CSS.
-I was also able to apply my knowledge in CSS variables and it turned out to be great.
-Finally I was also able to learn how to add icons in the head section with html.
-Also learnt how to use markdown, it was my first time doing this it's a bit challenging but I am up for any challenge that comes my way

-Here are some code snippets of what I've manged to apply in this projects.

```html adding Icons to the title section.
<head>
  <link
    rel="icon"
    type="image/png"
    sizes="32x32"
    href="images/favicon-32x32.png"
  />
</head>
```

```css
.centering-elements {
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on responsive web design principles as they are a bit confusing but with practice am sure I'll be able to learn and understand all the concepts properly.
I'd also like to improve on CSS grids and flex properties. Long way to go but it's for the best if I intend to become a guru in this side.
Learn JS and be able to apply the knowledge acquired in my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Word Spacing Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_word-spacing.php) - This helped me in spacing my words properly making it more readable to the user. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Aligning Elements Horizontally and Vertically](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center-vertical.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center an element both horizontally and vertically. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
